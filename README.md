📌 Known Minor Details and My Thoughts (Notes)

When the weight is placed very close, the torque is small, so the angle change may be slight.

When making decisions in the design phase, I was inspired by a seesaw game I saw online.

AI was used in the project to correct errors or malfunctions, and also in the CSS section because I couldn't get certain design elements to work the way I wanted.

Actually, AI was used not to create the project, but to support the creation process.

I really struggled with the CSS part, but after starting the JS part, I progressed more smoothly. However, getting the CSS part to the state I wanted was really challenging, but I managed it.
